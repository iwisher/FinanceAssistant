**Speaker 4:** The single best idea and the single best idea is a terrific lineup of conversation. On this Jobs Day and of course some election coverage. Major shout out to David Guerra. It it sounds romantic but it's not. He's in Wisconsin interviewing Senate candidates and then he's got to take a plane. He's got to wait here. It's 20 minutes late. It's an hour late. The car stuck in traffic because of Yankee game five baseball, whatever. And then he gets home and then he's getting on a plane again. He's leaving on a jet plane out to Pennsylvania where he'll really get the pulse of Pennsylvania over the weekend. And David Guerra will be part of our election night coverage. That's 5 p.m. Joe Mathew, Kaylee Lyons in at seven, John Pharaoh and MH join as well with David Guerra's wonderful perspective from uh at Pennsylvania. Wrapped around that is a Jobs Day and what the American economy means for the election. We started strong with Claudia Sahm, New Century Advisors.


**Speaker 5:** So having spent a lot of time in the last year or so thinking about what is this disconnect between what we see in the data, which largely looks pretty good and what we see coming out of people's mouths, which is largely not good. I think there's a residual effect of what we have gone through with the pandemic, the last four and a half years. I had a couple tell me, you know you're right, we look better on paper than we did four years ago, but we don't feel like it. And we're worried that tomorrow we might not be. So, I think we've come out of a period that's very confusing, things, there have been lots of twists and turns, most of them have not been for the good. So I can understand why people are not comfortable in like even if they've made progress and really embracing it. So I think that I think coming out of the pandemic, we do have some scars emotionally, even if we don't want to admit it. And I think also legitimate uncertainties about what comes next. So I think that's an extra factor that's weighing on the country and the sentiment this year.


**Speaker 4:** Claudia Sahm, the basic tone off the Jobs report and this was led by the great work of Anna Wong, we're thrilled joined us with Bloomberg Economics is it's not just the hurricanes. That's that's the message I got today. There's something else going on and that's got to be part of the discussion of the Fed two days after the election. We'll do the Fed decides November at seven.

**Speaker 4:** What we decided is Ellen Zentner of Morgan Stanley Investment does great analysis. Here is Ellen Zentner on your wage.


**Speaker 6:** Look, average hourly earnings, um, in this report, it's a tiny sample. And it can be distorted from month to month depending what hours worked do. So it's it's a calculation thing. Um and so 4% average hourly earnings on a year-over-year basis, you would say, gosh, that's a little bit higher than what would be consistent with the Fed's 2% goal. But you look at the employment cost index, which came out this week. That was Ellen's favorite measure. It continues to be the Fed's favorite measure. That's a much more comprehensive measure of wages and labor costs. And that is absolutely right now consistent with the Fed's 2% goal, which means that yes, it is it is healthy. So you're right, it's healthy, but it's not too healthy.


**Speaker 4:** Isn't it amazing? She's talking about that. Ellen Zentner there. We were looking at the same thing at the same time. Let me explain this. It's important. In the Jobs report, there are two jobs reports. And they've got average hourly this, weekly that. There's lots of earnings numbers. Most pros don't look at them. What they look at is the ECI, the Employment Cost Index, as Ms. Zentner mentions there. And it's a measurement of wages and benefits, which is a big deal because benefits is way more a part of your paycheck than you ever think about if you're fortunate enough to have a benefit package. And the answer is, and I don't have the numbers in front of me, but we were up at a lofty 5% and we've come down, but we haven't got the ECI back to where it was in 2019. And that's what a lot of people are watching as well. We'll watch that with Anna Wong of Bloomberg Economics, Ellen Zentner, Morgan Stanley, and Claudia Sahm of New Century Advisors as we go to the Fed meeting next week. We're out on YouTube.

**Speaker 8:** I think a lot of people think that you're supposed to be going to therapy once you're like having panic attacks every day, but before you get to that point, I think once you start even noticing that you feel a little bit off and you can't maintain this harmony that you once had in relationships, that could be a sign that maybe you want to go talk to somebody. There's always a benefit in talking to someone because we can all benefit from improved insight about ourselves and who we are and how we behave with other people. So if you're human, that's like a good indicator that you could benefit from talking to somebody.
